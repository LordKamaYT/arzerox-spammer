# Arzerox

All code is right of Kama. This code is a deviation of [GitHub Arzerox](https://github.com/lordkamayt/arzerox)

To use edit config.json and put token into variable TOKEN. Do not change code because it is entirely encoded and it might corrupt the normal code.

When config is edited right just launch start.py
Once bot is online just use the +nuke
