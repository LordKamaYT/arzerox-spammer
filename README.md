# Arzerox

All code is right of Kama. This code is a deviation of [GitHub Arzerox](https://github.com/lordkamayt/arzerox)

To use edit config.json and put token into variable TOKEN. Do not change code because it is entirely encoded and it might corrupt the normal code.

When config is edited right just download [Eagle](https://github.com/lordkamayt/eagle) and drag all the files of Arzerox-Spammer [Release 1.0](https://github.com/lordkamayt/arzerox-spammer/releases/tag/v1)

Then start start.py through command prompt in Eagle folder and type python start.py


Once bot is online just use the +nuke
